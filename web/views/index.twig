  						<div data-section-name="demos" >
  							<ul class="list">
	  							<li><strong>SeaCat: Securing Access to Medical Records</strong> - Shows how access to a medical record system can be secured from handheld devices like tablets and mobile phones. Stop by this demo if you are interested in how end-to-end isolation on both the network and the device can be used to provide secure access to sensitive data from mobile devices thus providing strong protection against data exfiltration. Securing access to an OpenMRS system (an open source medical record system) by deploying it in the SeaCat Application Containment framework.</li>

	  							<li><strong>OpenEdge: Dynamic and Secure Edge Network Applications and Services</strong> - The OpenEdge model allows different service and application providers to co-exist in the same edge network. As such the OpenEdge architecture is opening up and adding flexibility to edge networks in much the same way that cloud control architectures enabled flexibility and choice in data centers. OpenEdge makes it easy to become an application or service provider in an edge (access) network. This provides end users with choice and access to applications that can exploit the unique low latency and high capacity capabilities of modern edge networks.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Drone-carried Ad Hoc WiFi system for use in Fighting Wildfires</strong> - This is a  working prototype of a drone in emergency preparedness such as fire fighters and search and rescue teams. This showes the application of drone-carried ad hoc  networking system in the emergency preparedness. The project team will work closely with the Emergency Preparedness Department of the North Central Texas Council of Governments for intensive testing.</li>

	  							<li><strong>3D Tele-Rehabilitation</strong> - This demo has two identical systems located in (virtually) remote locations. The purpose of this demo is to show an application that demands high bandwidth and multi-modal communication between two remote systems. The application we choose is 3D Tele-Rehabilitation. The goal of the application is to virtually recreate a physical therapy session between a patient and a therapist. The 3D models of the two participants are captured using a 3D Camera that is available off the shelf (Microsoft Kinect v2.0). These 3D models are placed in a shared virtual environment of our choosing. To simulate the physical touch part of a physical therapy session we use a Haptic force- feedback device, the data from which is also transmitted to and fro to create a force feedback element in the virtual environment.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Viditor</strong> - An online video editor, letting people edit video wherever they are, whenever they want, any time they need it.</li>

	  							<li><strong>PlanIT Impact</strong> - PlanIT Impact is currently the only design tool that integrates gigabit internet speed, Open Data, and geo-locating infrastructure to provide a 3D-immersive resource impact reporting tool. Ultimately, the purpose of PlanIT Impact is to decrease the negative impacts that our built environment have on our environment. The current reality is that, according to 2013 US Energy Administration statistics, commercial and residential buildings emit almost as much CO2 and use nearly as much energy as the transportation and industrial sectors combined. While design and planning professionals, municipalities and other building-related individuals are actively pushing to reduce these impacts, the tools needed to do so are limited in function and prohibitively expensive to access.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Collaborative Exploration in Networked VR Environments, and Application to Remotely-Guided Classroom</strong> - An educational virtual reality environment that models a real alternative energy center. We seek to inspire and motivate the STEM workforce of tomorrow through exciting Virtual Reality approaches that teach renewable energy concepts and clearly show size, arrangement, and inter-operation of plant components. We are expanding the VR system to use high-performance networks to support bi-directional VR interaction between experts at a university or at the solar plant and high schools students at a STEM magnet academy. Such technologies will overcome geographic barriers to accessing expert instructors and will support virtual field trips with live instructors.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Creation of Situational Awareness for Emergency Response and Management Using Next Generation Gigabit Communication Systems </strong> - Ddemonstration to speed up emergency communications, bypassing the normal IP forwarding and dependency on IP routing tables. The demonstration will be conducted over Emulab testbed. Comparison with normal information forwarding using BGP will be conducted.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Enabling Highly Resilient and Efficient Microgrids through Ultra-Fast Programmable Networks </strong> - Microgrid is an emerging and promising paradigm to improve the resilience of the electric distribution infrastructure. The demo shows our current work on managing microgrid using ultra-fast programmable networks. Communication among various components in a microgrid is through a communication infrastructure, where many types of data with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements are communicated. The communication infrastructure plays a particularly critical role for microgrids with renewable energy sources due to their much smaller inertia as compared to traditional energy generation sources. We investigate using ultra-fast networks to support reliable and effective control and optimization for low-inertia microgrid.</li>

	  							<li><strong>A Cloud Enabled Virtual Reality Based Pedagogical Ecosystem for Solar and Wind Energy Education </strong> - Scalable and transferable cloud-based virtual reality pedagogical ecosystem that provides learners with the relevant skills in the area of solar and wind energy, and associated environmental engineering. The VR based system described here provides an innovative approach to green energy and environmental engineering education/training requirements by alleviating the need for a substantial investment in terms of equipment, facilities, lab space, field trips, and personnel.</li>

	  							<li><strong>CloudLab </strong> - CloudLab provides researchers with control and visibility all the way down to the bare metal. Provisioning an entire cloud inside of CloudLab takes only minutes. Most CloudLab resources provide hard isolation from other users, so CloudLab can support hundreds of simultaneous "slices", with each getting an artifact-free environment suitable for scientific experimentation with new cloud architectures.</li>

	  							<li><strong>GENI Cinema </strong> - Video streaming over the Internet, be it static or live streaming, is rapidly increasing in popularity. Many video streaming services exist to serve a variety of needs, such as video conferencing, entertainment, education, and the broadcast of live events. These services rely heavily on the server application to adapt to increasing and decreasing demand for a particular video resource.</li>

	  							<li><strong>Tracking World-wide Pollution </strong> - Researchers from the University of Texas at Dallas will demonstrate a system – enabled by GENI and US Ignite – that combines 50 massive NASA remote sensing datasets with Earth  System modeling products to provide an accurate global map of atmospheric aerosols through a  distributed, collaborative visualization system. City officials and planners can relate these maps to their local policy decisions and sources of pollution and conduct retrospective environmental impact assessments.</li>
